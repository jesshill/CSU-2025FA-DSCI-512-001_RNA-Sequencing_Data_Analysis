# CSU-2025FA-DSCI-512-001 

## Welcome to 'RNA-Sequencing Data Analysis'!

The course is aimed at graduate students interested in analyzing transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq). The course will provide an overview of typical RNA-seq workflows, including quality control, read mapping, differential expression, and other downstream analyses. Data analysis will be done with command-line tools. The course will be centered on real biological data, providing students with hands-on experience working with challenging data.
