## Learn R : PART 1

Perform this exercise on R Studio using Swirl

Later in this course, we will be using modules in R to analyze RNA-seq data. To prepare ourselves for those lessons, Homework #2 & #3 will take you on a tour of R. Some people already have experience in R, but many do not. Either way, you'll be fine. We will use **Swirl** an interactive R tutorial program and you can learn at the level that suits you best.

### Assignment

If you are new to R:
If you are new to the R language and environment, please take the first Swirl tutorials. Aim to get through Lessons 1 - 4.
Basic Building Blocks
Workspaces & Files
Sequences of Numbers
Vectors
However, the idea here is that we can do self-paced learning. If you need to focus on the first two lessons to really understand them, do that. If you want to jam ahead and learn more, you can do that, too. The idea is for us to learn at our own pace. You can still do the sections of the class that involve R even if you don't get through all the suggested lessons.
If you are an experienced or advanced R user:
Select some new lessons on Swirl to tackle topics you haven't mastered yet.
I highly recommend the tidyverse packages that can be found under “Exploratory Data Analysis” - this will cover ggplot2 - and “Getting and Cleaning Data” - this will cover dplyr.
Feel free to download and take any of the lessons available. These are listed on github and on the swirl webpage.
Work through the lessons that challenge you.
