# Differential expression analysis with DESeq2

## References

It is easy to follow the DESeq2 instructions even if you are not very familiar with R. Most of the commands in the .R script we'll use today are verbatim taken from the Vignette:

- Most recent vignettes are always linked to the [DESeq2 webpage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) under “Documentation”;
- Tip: Download your own copy of the instructions because they are difficult to find again.
