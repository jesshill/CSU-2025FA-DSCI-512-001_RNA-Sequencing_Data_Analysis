# Tabulation Using featureCounts

Today, let's begin by logging into alpine and checking how far we got before the break.

Refresher: 
- Navigate to [https://ondemand-rmacc.rc.colorado.edu/](https://ondemand-rmacc.rc.colorado.edu/)
- Login, then do the following...

```
$ acompile --time=2:00:00
$ conda env list 
$ conda activate <envName>
$ cd /scratch/alpine/<eID@colostate.edu>
```

- Next, navigate into your project folder, and the latest output folder.

Do you have the following? 

```
$ pwd
/scratch/alpine/jesshill@colostate.edu/2025_DSCI512/PROJ01_GomezOrte/03_output
$ ls 2024-11-21_output/03_feature/
EG01_counts.txt          EG04_counts.txt          EG07_counts.txt          EG10_counts.txt          EG13_counts.txt          EG16_counts.txt
EG01_counts.txt.summary  EG04_counts.txt.summary  EG07_counts.txt.summary  EG10_counts.txt.summary  EG13_counts.txt.summary  EG16_counts.txt.summary
EG02_counts.txt          EG05_counts.txt          EG08_counts.txt          EG11_counts.txt          EG14_counts.txt          EG17_counts.txt
EG02_counts.txt.summary  EG05_counts.txt.summary  EG08_counts.txt.summary  EG11_counts.txt.summary  EG14_counts.txt.summary  EG17_counts.txt.summary
EG03_counts.txt          EG06_counts.txt          EG09_counts.txt          EG12_counts.txt          EG15_counts.txt          EG18_counts.txt
EG03_counts.txt.summary  EG06_counts.txt.summary  EG09_counts.txt.summary  EG12_counts.txt.summary  EG15_counts.txt.summary  EG18_counts.txt.summary
```

- If YES, great!
- If NO, raise your hand and let me know please.

Once you have your output files, let's save our logfiles into their own directory...

```
# Navigate to your scripts folder:
$ pwd
/pl/active/onishimura_lab/ERIN/COURSES/2024_testing/PROJ01_GomezOrte/02_scripts
$ ls
$ mkdir 241121_logfiles
$ mv *.out 241121_logfiles
$ ls
```

**What happened during Alignment?**

What software did we use for alignment?  hisat2

What did we get out of it?   summary files and .sam files

HISAT2 takes as input **.fastq files** and **genome indexes** and produces a **.sam** (Sequence Alignment Map) file as output. There is one .sam file for each pair of paired-end .fastq files. It also gives us a report.

Let's peek in a summary file. It should be located within `03_output/<date>/02_hisat2`:

```
$ more EG01_summary.txt
5353080 reads; of these:
  5353080 (100.00%) were paired; of these:
    139104 (2.60%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    5083972 (94.97%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    130004 (2.43%) aligned concordantly >1 times
    ----
    139104 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      3860 (2.77%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    135244 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      270488 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        164326 (60.75%) aligned 0 times
        103380 (38.22%) aligned exactly 1 time
        2782 (1.03%) aligned >1 times
98.47% overall alignment rate
```

- **Aligned concordantly** - the forward and reverse reads aligned, one with the sense & one with the anti-sense strands.
- **Aligned discordantly** - both the forward and reverse aligned but the stranding doesn't make sense (ie: they're both pointed the same direction).
- **0 times** - either the forward or the reverse strand or both didn't align. Split them up and try again.
- **Multiple alignments** - some pairs map to more than one location. This often happens when there are repetitive regions within a genome. What happens then? HISAT2 keeps track of the primary location which is the location to which the pair maps with the highest possible alignment score. By default, HISAT2 will keep 2 primary alignments. You can change this option with -k. You can also tell HISAT2 to keep secondary alignments with –secondary. Now that our sequence reads are so long (150 bp x 2 = 300 bp) there are typically at least a few nucleotides that can distinguish repetitive reads.

Let's peek in a .sam file. It should be located somewhere in your directory `03_output`:

Yikes! That looks crazy.

- Basically, all you need to remember is that the .sam file will retain the sequence and quality scores of any reads that align to the genome. It will add to that information the location in the genome where the pair of (or individual) read(s) map.
- .sam format - wikipedia
- .sam lookup FLAG app - each pair of reads, if mapped, will be given a code called a “FLAG”. Enter the FLAG # in this little app to decipher the code.
- A .bam (Binary Alignment Map) file is a compressed .sam file. Think of it as a zipped file.
