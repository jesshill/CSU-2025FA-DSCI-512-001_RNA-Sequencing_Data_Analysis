# Cleaning up an RNA-seq project on ALPINE

**!!! Reminder:** Scratch space should be used for all compute jobs run on Alpine. This high-performance scratch directory is not backed up, and is not appropriate for long-term storage. **Data may be purged at any time subject to overall system needs. Files are automatically removed 90 days after their initial creation.**
