# Introduction to RNA-seq 

## What is RNA-seq? 

- A transcriptome is the sum set of total mRNA molecules from a given sample
- RNA-seq uses high-throughput sequencing to characterize a transcriptome by identifying all RNA sequences and simultaneously quantifying their abundances
- Also called transcriptome profiling

## How do we do RNA-seq? 

- Isolate mRNA convert it to cDNA
- Create a library of cDNA fragments with specialized adapter sequences ligated to each end
- Interrogate the sequence of each cDNA fragment on high-throughput sequencing instrumentation
- Identify the gene of origin for each fragment
- Quantify fragments emanating from each gene
