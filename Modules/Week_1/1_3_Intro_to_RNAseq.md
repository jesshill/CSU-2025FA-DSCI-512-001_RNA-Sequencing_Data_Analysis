# Introduction to RNA-seq 

## What is RNA-seq? 

- A transcriptome is the sum set of total mRNA molecules from a given sample
- RNA-seq uses high-throughput sequencing to characterize a transcriptome by identifying all RNA sequences and simultaneously quantifying their abundances
- Also called transcriptome profiling

## How do we do RNA-seq? 

1. Isolate mRNA convert it to cDNA
2. Create a library of cDNA fragments with specialized adapter sequences ligated to each end
3. Interrogate the sequence of each cDNA fragment on high-throughput sequencing instrumentation
4. Identify the gene of origin for each fragment
5. Quantify fragments emanating from each gene

## What can we learn from RNA-seq?

### Discovery 

- Annotate genomes
- Find new transcripts, splice junctions, polyA sites
- Identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) differences

### Comparison

- RNA abundance differences between conditions
- Splice/isoform differences between conditions
- Compare how different SNP-containing alleles are expressed
