# ALPINE

We will do most of our work in this class on the ALPINE supercomputer system. We are doing this for a few reasons ...

1. Everyone will be on the same platform (no Mac v. PC issues)
2. We can do things really fast by using the power of the supercomputer system
3. You will be trained and ready to go on ALPINE for your large-scale projects!

ALPINE is an example of a **High-Performance Computing system** or HPC. HPC is a means of performing large computational tasks on **supercomputers** or **compute clusters** in a way that takes advantage of their ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

**Supercomputers** in the crudest terms are basically what happens if you glued 100's or 1000's of individual computers together. You end up making a giant computer with more functionality.

**ALPINE** is a joint venture between Colorado State University and CU Boulder and is sponsored by those institutes and by a grant from the National Science Foundation. ALPINE is shared between CU Boulder, Colorado State University, CU Anschutz, and RMACC (Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium, a network of >20 other academic institutions in Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico).

However, please keep in mind that a supercomputer isn't required for RNA-seq data analysis. Most of these tasks can be done on a personal MAC or LINUX computer. PCs can also theoretically do the same tasks but it will be much more challenging to install the software.

Today, we will do the following together ...

1. Register for ALPINE if you haven't already
2. Log into ALPINE using OnDemand - see how many students can do this
3. Review some concepts about ALPINE

Thursday, we will ...

1. Review the ALPINE High Performance Compute System
2. Initiate a “conda virtual environment” where we can install RNA-seq software
3. Install software within our conda environment
