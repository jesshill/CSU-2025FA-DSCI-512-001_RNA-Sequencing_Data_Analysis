# Installing Software on ALPINE

Today we will explore two ways to access software on ALPINE. The first is the **modules system**. This will allow us to use software that the Research Computing team has already pre-installed and configured for us.

The second is through creation of a custom **Anaconda environment**. This will allow us to create a full environment of software we will use for this class. **Conda** is the open-source, cross-platform package and environment managment system used to create custom Anaconda environments. Similarly, we also commonly use **mamba**. mamba is a reimpliment of the conda package manager in C++ designed for speed and efficiency. Mamba offers the same environment management capabilities, including creation and managament of isolated environments. 

Here are the software packages we'll need for this class and how we'll install each:

| Software Package  | What it does | How we'll install it |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| sra-toolkit | downloads genomics data from online databases	 | modules |
