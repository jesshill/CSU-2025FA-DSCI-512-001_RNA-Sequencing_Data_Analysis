# Project Initation

We will now start a project. In doing so, let's introduce or review some aspects of the ALPINE architecture.

## Start an RNA-seq data analysis project

We will start a data analysis directory for this class and initiate a project within that directory.

Currently, we are in our home directory `/home/jesshill@colostate.edu/`. The ALPINE staff have set up directories for each user. Let's review the general ALPINE Architecture:

### The Alpine System:

### Alpine File Storage: 

[Detailed information about the file storage on ALPINE](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/filesystems.html)

Whereas the nodes are analogous to CPU and memory on your home laptop, the filesystem is analogous to your hard drive. This is where data will be stored. The ALPINE team has pre-organized several nice directories where each user can house their data. Each space has a designated purpose.

Here are the different file storage spaces available:
