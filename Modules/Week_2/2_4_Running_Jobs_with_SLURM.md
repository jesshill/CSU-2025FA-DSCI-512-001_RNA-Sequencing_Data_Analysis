### A review of vocabulary words

-High-Performance Computing (HPC) - this is the field of computing that uses supercomputers, compute clusters, or servers to solve computational tasks. It is most often used in STEM research fields but has also expanded to business and industry fields.
-Supercomputers and compute clusters - are both architectures of computers in which multiple, small computers are stitched together so they function as a single, big computer. Differ in their scale with the supercomputer term being used for larger systems.
-Servers - this is another catch-all term that can also refer to a compute cluster (of varying sizes, some are small) but implies that the system is hosting some function for users.
