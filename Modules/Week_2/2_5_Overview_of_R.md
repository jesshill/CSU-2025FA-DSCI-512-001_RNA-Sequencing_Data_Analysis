First, you'll need to ensure that you have installed **R** and **R-studio**. Please see [Computer Requirements](../../Computer_Requirements.md) for instructions on how to install those applications.

The homework assignments will be done in R-studio using [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/). So you will need to familiarize yourself with the R-Studio layout.
