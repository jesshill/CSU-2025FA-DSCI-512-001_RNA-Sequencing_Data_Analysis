# Course Description - 2025

Linux/Unix is the primary platform for computational science. The goal of this course is to train scientists in its use with particular emphasis on the needs of bioinformatics users. The course covers basic Linux commands and utilities, running and managing computational jobs, and handling and manipulating large biological datasets.

<ins>By the end of the course, students will:

- Be comfortable with the Linux command line and command-line programs, including the ability to move, create, or edit files and directories
- Know how to search, manipulate, and process large datasets
- Write and execute small bash script programs
- Know how to connect to a remote server like the (Alpine)[https://www.colorado.edu/rc/alpine] system and run jobs on it. You can find more information and documentation about Alpine [here](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clusters/alpine/index.html).

# Expectations

You are expected to be familiar with the [Student Code of Conduct](https://resolutioncenter.colostate.edu/conduct/code/). This course will adhere to the [CSU Academic Integrity Policy](https://resolutioncenter.colostate.edu/conduct/academic-integrity/). At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course, a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services, and communication with your professor and/or graduate program director.

Colorado State University has clear [Principles of Community](https://inclusiveexcellence.colostate.edu/about/principles-of-community). We each have the responsibility to uphold these values as we interact with one another and learn.

Please know that use of Chegg, Course Hero, or other web services that market themselves as tutoring or study guides are not permitted in this course. Many instances of their use are a violation of the Student Integrity Policy.

# ChatGPT Statement

*Things may change in future classes. Other professors will have different statements.*

I implore everyone to think deeply about their own **personal goals** for this class. What do you want to master? What do you want to take with you after you leave?

Chances are, you want to gain a **skillset** to apply to your research and career.

The best practices for learning new skills are to **practice, struggle, experiment, spend time, think deeply, and sit with the material.**

ChatGPT has advantages and disadvantages in this learning process.

**Beneficial usage and suggestions:**

- Conversational: A prompt like “Teach me how to use a for loop in bash scripting” can organize information succinctly without ads.
  - Warning: information is not always accurate
- Grammar & Light editing: Using ChatGPT to decode tricky English turns-of-phase or assist with grammar
  - Tip: I suggest Grammarly. Even its free version is more honed at this task and integrated into other programs. Paid version is impressive.

**I strongly discourage the following usage:**

- Generative - Using ChatGPT to write your code for assignments, the final project, or in general is risky (can be wrong) and negatively impacts learning.

Unsure about what is ok and not ok?

You can always e-mail me to ask. Also, if you would like to disclose your usage of ChatGPT in any assignment or in the Exam Project, I encourage you to do so. You can include a statement like…

- I did not use Generative AI for this assignment.
- Generative AI helped with grammar and readability, but the original writing was my own.
- Generative AI helped with idea generation, but I wrote the assignment myself.
- A small amount of my work (just a couple of sentences) was written by Generative AI.
- Generative AI significantly wrote my work, but I edited it.

Also - please contact me if you are feeling overwhelmed or getting behind in the class. I'd rather give you the opportunity to learn the content than put you in a situation where you feel you need to speed through without learning using ChatGPT.

# Health and Safety

Don't feel pressured to come to class if you are ill. Staying home when you are sick prevents the spread of disease. If this happens, you can use the simulcast and recorded options.

# Jessica's Teaching & Diversity Statement

**Diversity Statement:** I am committed to supporting the success of all students and I recognize that different students, depending on their individual attributes, have different needs. I celebrate the many ways scientists bring their complex sensibilities and their unique identities to our fields. I work to encourage STEM communities to welcome scientists from traditionally under-represented demographics by identifying and then resolving barriers to inclusion.

**Teaching Statement:** Though I am not a well seasoned teacher, I have worked and will continue to work on developing course materials that prepare students for real world scenarios through project-based learning, intentional training situations, and using hardware and software employed in the field. Short term teaching goals include facilitating students understanding of the learning objectives. Long term, I would like to ignite curiosity and foster skillsets that empower students to be lifelong learners. 

**Cultivating an inclusive classroom:** I strive to ensure our classroom, our virtual spaces, and our interactions are respectful and kind. Mutual respect, civility, and good communication are crucial to universal learning. I ask that you all join me in taking on the personal responsibility to treat one another with empathy, kindness, and respect.

**Names & Pronouns:** I prefer to be called “Jess” in this class but "Dr. Hill" can be tolerated. I am not picky between "Jess" and "Jessica". I use she/her pronouns. I want to get your names and pronouns right. Please feel welcome to share your preferred names, pronouns, and pronunciations with me on your name tags, via e-mail, or by using NameCoach on Canvas.

**Computational Biology:** The fields of computation and biology have histories that are fraught with stereotypes, biases, and even serious power abuses. In the US, these fields were historically dominated by scientists from traditionally majority identities, and that is also what has been depicted in fiction and film. The history and media representations can feed into our implicit biases and can impact how we assess our own sense of belonging or competency. An acknowledgement of this reality is the first step to deconstructing it and empowering a more inclusive future.

I’m excited to work with you and get to know all of you!
